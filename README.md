# Scripts for verifying checksums (md5 and sum)

## check_md5sums.sh

Check md5sums on any md5 files found in directory tree (starting in cwd).
Md5 files need to end in `.md5` (case insensitive), or be named `MD5SUM`,
or `MD5SUMS` (case insensitive).

#### Usage:

    $ ./check_md5sums.sh

#### Options:

    -?, -h  show help
    -v      be more verbose


## checksum.sh

Verify checksums generated by the `sum` command. Will only check files found
both in the CHECKSUMS file, and on disk.

Note that this script will not search recursively for input files but will
check the files given in a `CHECKSUMS` file.

#### Usage:

    $ ./checksum.sh CHECKSUMS

#### Options:

    -?, -h    show help
    -v        be more verbose
    CHECKSUMS file with sums generated by the `sum` command
